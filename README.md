Verve - Torque 3D

1. Installation

Copy the contents of this zip file into your Torque 3D directory. A new
template containing all of the files needed to use Verve has been added to
the available templates. If you are integrating Verve into your own
projects, you simply need to copy the source files and project config files
into your project folder.

2. Documentation

All of the documentation is provided online:

3. Getting Started

All you need to do to load up Verve is to open the World Editor and hit the
Verve Editor button! I highly recommend that you take a look at some of the
basic features and tutorials in the documentation to help familiarise 
yourself with the tool.
